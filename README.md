# Kickstarter Tracker

A WIP crossplatform app for tracking kickstarter projects

Currently very limited (read as basically unusable), but plan is to eventually be able
to link a project from kickstarter (also gamefound) and be able to quickly find info like
delivery date & progress, amount pledged, options for upgraded pledges and add-ons, project
closing dates, estimated pledge manager dates and other stuff. All stuff that can be found by
trawling through project pages, but this project aims to condense and consolidate it all into
easy to find consistent locations, and provide views showing all your backed/followed projects.

## Where is it at?
Updated 2021-July-03 (init commit)

Not yet usable in any meaningful way. Projects (very limited) can be added and seen in release order,
but nothing is saved. and everything not saved will be lost. Naturally next step is to add some permenance,
and get communication with a database sorted out.

## THE PLAN
<ol>
  <li> Projects can be added to calendar view </li>
  <li> Plan is a bit of exageration - fill out the plan </li>
</ol>

## On the off chance you are reading this ...
... and you aren't me, welcome! I'm doing this only as a personal project cause I think it'd be useful
to me. As such this is happening in my spare time and slowly. Also I haven't used dart or flutter before,
and I'm only a graduate software eng. So manage your expectations accordingly. That being said,
this is an open source project (if I can be bothered I'll chuck the right licensing on it but something like
MIT or LGPL) and you can feel free to do what you like with it (but no responsibilty on my end).
If you're interested and have questions/feedback, or want to help with the development, open an issue
and I'll get back to you when I can, or if you know what you're doing, make a fork and open a pull request.
