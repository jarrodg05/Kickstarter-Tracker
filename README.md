# Kickstarter Tracker

A WIP crossplatform app for tracking kickstarter projects

Currently very limited (read as basically unusable), but plan is to eventually be able
to link a project from kickstarter (also gamefound) and be able to quickly find info like
delivery date & progress, amount pledged, options for upgraded pledges and add-ons, project
closing dates, estimated pledge manager dates and other stuff. All stuff that can be found by
trawling through project pages, but this project aims to condense and consolidate it all into
easy to find consistent locations, and provide views showing all your backed/followed projects.

## Where is it at?
Updated 2021-August-15 (SHA 2ela89f6)

Projects can be added and saved to a backing google firestore. The projects are viewable in an
ordered list on the main page. Clicking on a project will open a page with more info about
that project. Currently the project is unable to be edited, but pledges can be added to the
project. 

## THE PLAN
<ol>
  <li> <s> Projects can be added to calendar view </s> </li>
  <li> <s> Plan is a bit of exageration - fill out the plan</s> </li>
  <li> <s> Pledges can be added to a project </s> </li>
  <li> Add a navigation bar at bottom(?) of each page </li>
  <li> Enable editing of projects </li>
  <li> Enable editing of pledges </li>
  <li> Pretty things up a bit </li>
  <li> Add some views for pledge information - e.g. total not paid </li>
  <li> Custom date picker for adding projects - just want to pick months not days </li>
  <li> More info for projects & pledges </li>
</ol>

## On the off chance you are reading this ...
... and you aren't me, welcome! I'm doing this only as a personal project cause I think it'd be useful
to me. As such this is happening in my spare time and slowly. Also I haven't used dart or flutter before,
and I'm only a graduate software eng. So manage your expectations accordingly. That being said,
this is an open source project (if I can be bothered I'll chuck the right licensing on it but something like
MIT or LGPL) and you can feel free to do what you like with it (but no responsibilty on my end).
If you're interested and have questions/feedback, or want to help with the development, open an issue
and I'll get back to you when I can, or if you know what you're doing, make a fork and open a pull request.
